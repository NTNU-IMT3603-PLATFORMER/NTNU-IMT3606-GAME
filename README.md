 ## Important notes about MVP
 - Sprites and animations are temporary (prototypes)
 - There are moving platforms that you sometimes have to wait for. If you can't find the way forward, try to wait for a moving platform to appear :)
 - Nothing happens after defeating boss, but you still win the game in our estimation!
 
 There are a few bugs including (but not limited to) the following:
 - You bounce when on moving platform moving upwards
 - Transformations do not have custom sprites, but are represented as colors at the moment
 - Transformations can have unexpected behaviour
 - You don't take damage when colliding with boss
 - Enemy hitboxes can be weird
 - There are visual glitches
