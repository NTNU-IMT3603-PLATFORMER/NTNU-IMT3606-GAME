# Sheesh Unity Game

## Description

**What is Sheesh?**

Sheesh is a 2D platformer action game themed around nature.

Play as the heroine and overcome the worlds obstacles and its hostile enemies. The heroine must learn to combat and move around these dangerous environments and defeat the evil corrupting the lands once and for all.

Play your way as you defeat dark creatures and level up your heroine the way you want. Steal blood with each succesful strike to mend yourself, siphon souls from your defeated enemies to level up, and optionally you can transform into different animalistic beasts with their own playstyle. Choice is yours.

## Background

As university students from [NTNU](https://www.ntnu.edu/about), we accepted this group project by our teachers to learn and make a game on the Unity game engine. It gave us first hand experience and perspective on game development and taught us about game design, optimalization, C# and Unity knowledge, and much more. This has been an incredibly educational journey for us and we are satisified with the end product considering our timeframe.

## Getting Started
